Project Description

This project aims to develop an advanced, voice-command-operated drone tailored for 
solo content creators who require a flexible, autonomous filming partner. The drone 
will feature onboard AI for immediate command recognition and execution, with additional
processing support from cloud services for more complex commands and functionalities. 
It will offer a blend of object recognition and possibly a device-based tracking system 
to follow the user or specific gestures accurately. The drone is designed to be compact, 
portable, yet robust enough for both indoor and outdoor use, ensuring high-quality 4K video 
recording with optimal frame rates and field of view. Safety features, including low battery 
alerts and safe landing protocols, will be integral, along with the flexibility of manual and 
app-based control for future updates. The project will also explore the feasibility of live streaming 
capabilities as a forward-looking feature. Given the intensive processing and operational demands, 
the drone will incorporate a high-capacity yet lightweight battery to balance flight time with 
performance.

Objectives

1. **Develop a compact, reliable drone with advanced voice command capabilities** for easy, solo operation by content creators.
2. **Implement both onboard and cloud-based AI processing** for command recognition and execution, covering common commands directly and offloading complex processing to the cloud.
3. **Incorporate high-quality 4K camera technology** with superior stabilization for professional-grade video and photography.
4. **Design the drone for both indoor and outdoor versatility,** ensuring stable flight and recording under various conditions.
5. **Ensure safety through intelligent battery management,** including clear low battery warnings and automated safe landing procedures.
6. **Offer both manual and app-based control options,** with considerations for extending flight time in manual mode.
7. **Evaluate and implement the best storage solutions** for high-resolution content based on team recommendations and market standards.
8. **Explore the potential for live streaming capabilities** as a value-added feature for real-time content sharing.

###Mechanical Requirements

1. Dimensions and Size:
   - Ideal dimensions could be in the range of 250mm to 350mm diagonally (rotor to rotor), 
   - Target weight, excluding the payload, could be around 700g to 1.5kg, 
2. Payload Capacity:
   - A payload capacity of up to 500g might be sufficient to support a high-quality camera and additional sensors without compromising flight performance.
3. Top Speed and Flight Time:
   - A top speed of around 40-50 km/h (25-30 mph) would offer a good balance for both dynamic outdoor shots and controlled indoor use.
   - Targeting a flight time of around 20-30 minutes on a single charge, considering the balance between battery capacity and overall drone weight.
4. Propulsion System:
   - Brushless motors combined with high-efficiency propellers to ensure responsive, stable flight and maneuverability across a range of speeds and conditions.
5. Material Selection:
   - Utilization of lightweight, high-strength materials such as carbon fiber for the frame, combined with durable plastics for the body, to achieve the desired durability and weight.
Specify the end material we might be using, this is also going to change IN THE FUTURE BASED ON FUNDING AND MARKET RESEARCH.

### Electronic Requirements

1. Voice Command Module:
   - A high-quality, noise-canceling microphone system paired with a powerful, efficient processor capable of real-time voice command recognition and processing.

2. Camera Specifications:
   - A 4K resolution camera capable of at least 30fps, with a wide field of view (around 90° to 120°), and built-in stabilization (gimbal or electronic) for smooth video capture.
3. Sensors for Navigation and Safety:
   - Integration of GPS for outdoor navigation, along with ultrasonic and infrared sensors for indoor navigation and obstacle avoidance. An advanced return-to-home feature for low battery or loss of signal scenarios.
4. Battery Specifications:
   - A high-capacity LiPo battery (e.g., 4000-5000mAh) 
5. Connectivity Options:
   - Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for local control and data transmission, with the potential for LTE integration for remote operations and live streaming capabilities.

### Coding Requirements
1. **Firmware and Flight Control Software:**
   - The software must support autonomous flight modes, voice command recognition, obstacle avoidance, and dynamic tracking. Integration with onboard and cloud-based processing for advanced commands and functionalities.
2. **Voice Command Processing:**
   - The AI for voice recognition should be capable of understanding and executing a wide range of commands in real-time, with the flexibility to learn and adapt to the user's voice and commands over time.
3. **User Interface and Control Options:**
   - A user-friendly manual control receiver for direct operation, with a seamless switch between manual and voice command modes. An intuitive app interface for advanced settings, live view, and additional controls.
4. **Data Management and Storage:**
   - Onboard storage of at least 128GB to accommodate high-resolution video and photos, with support for expandable storage via SD cards and cloud storage options for additional backup and easy access to content.
